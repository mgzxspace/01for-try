Hello everyone My name is ZhengXingWang, english name isFox. I come from YunNan, form near ZhaoTong. Yes, I'm regionally, Now i am a college student ,studying in Shanghai Institute of Technology .majoring  information management and system

Normally, there is nothing abnormal about my life,I take my courses , go  for eating , do my chores. I spent the day as spent  every other day, quietly polishing the routine of my life until it gleamed with perfection.

But when i did a part-time job in Milstone, everything had changed.my work was looking for students who wanna improve spoken English. I did not very  well in this job. But i had an ideal , why not  try this course. I am also the one need to learn spoken english, to enhance the overall level of my english. If I can't escape it, then just make it perfectly. to faght with it. Of couse,now, when looking back on the past, it has gradully became a part of my life.
After taking  initial classes, I decided to attend the  intermediate class. 

1.2
and now, I am taking video class. life is hectic and  with pressure.But i am happy ,sinse my spoken english learning , I have developed a taste for idiomatic [??di??m?t?k]   english and excellent partner.
of couse , english practice is not easy,  somtimes, the long sentences drive me crazy,but, l know  we all have  the moment of desperations.  But if we  can face them head on, that's when we find out just how strong we really are. And when we get in trouble , we can-ask  teacher Doffy for help,  she is alway here when there-is crisis. 

1.3
in college,  I think raltionship  with classmates  is cooler than high school ,   and there is not good atmoshere  of learning.     My classmates only want to  pass the exam ,but to really master something. Gradually  even the teachers just stress how to cope with the test.   it's a stange mindset ,right.    it's totally defferent in Milstone, everyone is aggresive and we all smile at each other , encorage each other .

if you wonder what most impoint I get from Mileston, form spoken english learning,I  would say it's transformatiom in personality, I get happy, I get more tough, the last is english.
do you know, during ths past high school  years, the academic pressure in school and lots of terrible things of family made me sad,  made crazy,made me numb,   I was at loss, sometimes,even  got into totall desperation . For a loog time,   I didn't    laught  ,and I've even  been called  dead fish fcae. 
2.2
utill I came into college and then came across Mileston  . in the last year ,I got half of my new cognition  from Milestone,you know, the content of system class.if say enriching cognition and having a loog term deeply thinking about many things, have made  me get confidence , find the direction  of  futher ,and don't feel sad  again,   then the life of leaning with you in Milestone make me happy again , life get warm. I gradualy understand the ralationship with others is important, commuinicating is interesting, everyone have a shining side, they are charming, interesting,exellent , their effors for a perfect  perfomance can move you. in a words i love milestone, l love you. I believe we all have a bright futher

this spring we are leaning Desperate Housewives, this TV show is very popular in-America.  it  gives  me lots of impression-about waht is life. 
i get life is complex. there is not absolute perfection.
As the saying goes,life is a tragedy when you look loser,but in the distance ,it's a comedy, like we watch the vidioe, its funny.all right.we can learn something from its. So waht's the guadance ,solution,what lesson I get form it ,is to learn more, to understand more ,to enhance your spritual level , and of ourse,to be independent in economic ,so that you can cope with more things ,you treat life softly ,can live peacefull and happilya
